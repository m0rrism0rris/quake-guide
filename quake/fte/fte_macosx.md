### MULTIPLAYER QUAKE FOR MAC OS X
#### 1—Engine
Download your preferred version of FTE (file starting with *fteqw-macosx-*) from <https://6464.at/~rhoenie/>
I suggest version 5506
Place the .app in your Applications folder

###### 2.1—Demo
Download *pak0.pak* from <https://github.com/shaunlebron/blinky/blob/master/game/id1/pak0.pak?raw=true>  
Place it in the id1 folder from earlier  
Skip section 2.2  

###### 2.2—Full Version
Install Quake using Steam, like any other game  
Right-click on Quake in the sidebar and select *Properties*  
Go to the *Local Files* tab and select *Browse Local Files*  
This folder contains 7 different versions of Quake  
Ignore them all, unless you want to relive the 90s (I suggest *WinQuake.exe*)  
Open the enclosed *Id1* folder and copy *PAK0.PAK* and *PAK1.PAK* to your id1 folder from earlier  

#### 3—Bots
For bot
Get FBCA from <https://s3.amazonaws.com/neogeographica-downloads/guides/deathmatch_with_bots/fbca_quickstart.zip>
